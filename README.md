# AI-Based-Intrusion-Detection-for-Vehicle-CAN-Networks-Securing-Modern-Vehicles
Modern vehicles rely on CAN, which lacks built-in security and is vulnerable to spoofing, replay, and fuzzing attacks.  IDS learns normal CAN traffic patterns and flags or blocks anomalous messages in real time.  It detects attacks like spoofed RPM, brake/speed mismatches, fuzzing floods, and stealthy sensor manipulation.
